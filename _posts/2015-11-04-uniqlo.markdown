## What are uniqlo using?

* Site: http://www.uniqlo.com/

* CDN: https://www.akamai.com, company history, https://www.akamai.com/us/en/about/company-history.jsp

* CMS: http://magento.com, Prototype.js, Varnish cache

* Lightbox clone with media support: https://github.com/scaron/prettyphoto

## Interesting things

* It comments out the background light blue color: http://d2h2vnfmmg5sct.cloudfront.net/images/birthday_backgroundlighter1.png

* So it has a news letter box, but it is hidden, see code below.

* So it has own ticket system, "UQ ticket : UNSH-173". What is "UNSH"?

```
