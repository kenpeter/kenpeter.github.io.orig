NOTE, this doesn't mean to embarrass anyone, but it is more like a treasure hunting game for me.

### The uniqlo website
http://www.uniqlo.com/au

![alt text][uniqlo_au]

### Tech stack
* CDN: https://www.akamai.com, company history, https://www.akamai.com/us/en/about/company-history.jsp

* CMS: http://magento.com, Prototype.js, Varnish cache

* Lightbox clone with media support: https://github.com/scaron/prettyphoto


### Interesting things
* There is a comment: "the following block of code is commented based on the instruction in the release of this UQ ticket : UNSH-173". It has own ticket system, "UQ ticket : UNSH-173". What is "UNSH"?

* There is a page called special-ajax-page.js. "added by mahendra for validation effect 28 July 2015, script.aculo.us effects.js v1.8.2", so there is a developer called mahendra in uniqlo.

* The image shows there are some hidden stuff. e.g. "The delivery service is in provision"
